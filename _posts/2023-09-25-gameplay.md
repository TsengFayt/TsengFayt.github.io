> Gartic Phone is played through a mix of writing and drawing prompts with specific rulesets based on the game mode selected. The game features 15 default modes called `Presets` but can be expanded upon by hosts and players with the use of custom settings. Once the host has configured the settings, a brief countdown occurs, and the round begins.

## ▶️ How to Play

> ***

> Gartic Phone games consist of 'turns' (drawing/writing) which make up each 'round'. Depending on the mode, players will take turns drawing and/or writing until the round is over, at which point albums are generated which display the results during the 'reveal'.

## 🖱️ Interface

> ***

> Once a game has started, information about the current game is displayed and actions are controlled with the interface which includes the turn counter (1), timer (2), canvas (3), color picker (4), drawing tools (5) (or animation tools if animation is enabled), size selector (6), opacity slider (7), download (8), and mute (9).
{: .prompt-danger }

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TsengFayt/garticphonemodes/main/img/drawingtools/interface.webp)

> `Turn Counter` 1️⃣ • Displays information about the current turn (current turn / total number of turns) and how many players have tapped done (finished players / total number of players).

> `Timer` 2️⃣ • Displays a filled circle that slowly empties as the timer counts down. An alert sound plays when the timer is almost finished. If 'Host's Decision' is chosen, the timer instead displays a lock symbol with the total elapsed time below.

> `Canvas` 3️⃣ • The main area where players draw and color their artwork during drawing turns.

> `Color Picker` 4️⃣ • Displays colors that can be selected and applied to the canvas with drawing tools. For more info check out our page on [color palettes](/posts/color-palettes/).

> `Drawing Tools` 5️⃣ • Consists of a variety of tools the player can use to interact with the canvas. If animation is enabled some drawing tools are replaced with animation tools.

> `Size Selector` 6️⃣ • Sets the thickness of compatible tools. Options include very small, small, medium, large, and vary large. These can be expanded with plugins.

> `Opacity Slider` 7️⃣ • Sets the opacity of compatible tools. There are ten notches from min (almost completely transparent) to max (fully opaque).

> `Download` 8️⃣ • Downloads the current canvas as an image.

> `Mute` 9️⃣ • Allows the player to mute/unmute the game's sound effects.
