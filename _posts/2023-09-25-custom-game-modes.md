> ```Credit``` • Attribution to the creator/community credited with inventing the game mode.

> ```Description``` • An explanation of the premise and/or goal of the mode. May include visual examples.

> ```Setup``` • Detailed instructions on parameters needed to setup and/or play the mode (i.e. 'use the line tool to separate the canvas into 4 equally sized corners` or 'draw an example of a trait for others to replicate').

> ```Custom Settings Link``` • Shareable link to copy the exact settings for the selected mode.

> ```Custom Settings``` • Settings for each option in Custom Settings used to recreate a lobby with the custom game mode are included in a table. If the category is blank (-) then it is optional or up to the host to decide what option fits best based on the number of players or what is popular with their community. If a value is present, such as a description, or ON / OFF, then it is either required or strongly recommended for the mode to work properly.

## 🔗 Ross Mode

> `Description`

> Ross Mode (named after the creator, Cerbross) is a mashup mode. The goal is to take traits (i.e. color palette, species, body type/parts/features, clothing/accessories, objects, etc.) and merge them together into an entirely new character or by using an OC (original character) paired with the given traits. As an example, the host will set the number of turns to 5. In the first 4 turns, players will draw and label traits. For this example we will say the 4 traits provided were: sunglasses, the colors blue / pink, cat species, and tall. In the fifth (final) round, the player will combine the 4 traits with either their OC or simply create and entirely new character with the given traits.

> `Setup`

> The number of turns should be the intended number of traits, plus 1 round to combine them. For example, if players want to combine 4 traits, the number of turns should be set to 5. It is also highly recommended to have the players use the line tool to separate the canvas into 4 equally sized quadrants during the first turn to allow space for each remaining player to add an additional trait. Optionally, players may leave a blank space in the middle for the result to be drawn, however most players prefer to use the 'Filled Rectangle' tool set to White to cover the entire canvas at the start of the final turn. If this method is used, it is highly recommended that players screenshot the preview provided at the start of the final round before covering it.
